Objects are complex variables that can contain other variables, lists, both known as “attributes”, and even their own subprograms and functions (these are called methods). Objects shorten the amount of code needed to perform repeating tasks. An object is defined with a class statement and is “instantiated” with its first method, usually called __init__. Note the DOUBLE underscores before and after the name of this “constructor” method. 

Objects can be reused in many programs, so it is possible that some of the object’s attributes will have the same name as a variable in a program where it is used. To avoid confusion, all of the object’s attributes are preceded by the word “self.” E.g. self.value. To hide (encapsulate) the values of internal variables/attributes from the rest of the program, we can put an underscore in front of its name.
